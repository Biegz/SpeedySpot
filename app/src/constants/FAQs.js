    title: 'Who are you guys?',
    content:
      'This app was made by Stony Brook students Kushal Delhiwala, Austin Biegler, and Manpreet Singh. We made this with the assistance of Professor Tony Scarlatos in the Computer Science Department, as part of an experiment to see if a crowdsourced parking app can alleviate congestion here at Stony Brook. This app ultimately is just a beta (and there may be some bugs), so we thank you so much for taking a small bit of time out of your day to use it and help with our project',
